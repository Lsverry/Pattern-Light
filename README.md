# PatternLight
PatternLight is a memory game dedicated to people who want to train and keep their memory healthy.

The game offers users a challenge that gets more difficult as they level up and three chances before the game is over.

## Features
- Information screen:
    - Displays the name of the game at the top.
    - It offers the user the opportunity to watch a tutorial or start the game.
    - Displays feedback depending on whether the user hits, misses or has to start over.

- Mini level display:
    - Displays the current level of difficulty.
    - Starts at level 1 by default.

- Lives:
    - Three hearts represent the chances you have before the game ends.
    - Every failure will turn off a heart.
    - If the game ends, the user will get the three hearts back.

- Buttons: 
    - Four interactive buttons.
    - Have a responsive design which adapts to different screen sizes to make the best use of space. 
    - They also show the sequence that the user must follow to advance by means of red lights.

### Testing
- I have confirmed that the design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- I have confirmed that the game displays the sequence that the user must follow correctly.
- I have confirmed that the main screen displays user feedback in response to their actions correctly.
- I have found that each success raises one level of difficulty appropriately. 
- Lives are reduced appropriately each time a failure is made.
- I have tested the game in several browsers such as Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox to make sure it is compatible and works fine in all of them.
